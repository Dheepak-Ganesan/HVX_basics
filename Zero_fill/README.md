zero_fill explanation:

1. v1 = Q6_V_vzero();: This line initializes the v1 vector to zero using the Hexagon intrinsic Q6_V_vzero(). It sets all elements of the vector v1 to zero.

2. Unsigned int *v1_ptr = (unsigned int *)&v1;: This line creates a pointer v1_ptr to the memory address of v1. The vector v1 is treated as an array of unsigned int values, allowing access to its individual elements as if they were simple integers.
